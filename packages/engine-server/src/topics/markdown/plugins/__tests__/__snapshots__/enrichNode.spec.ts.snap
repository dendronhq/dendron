The \\\\*\\\\*hierarchical\\\\*\\\\* note taking tool that \\\\*\\\\*grows\\\\*\\\\* as you do.

Dendron is an \\\\*\\\\*open-source, local-first, markdown-based, note-taking tool\\\\*\\\\* built on top of \\\\[VSCode](https&#x3A;//code.visualstudio.com/). Like most such tools,  Dendron supports all the usual features you would expect like tagging, backlinks, a graph view, split panes, and so forth. But it doesn't stop there - whereas most tools (try to make it) easy to \\\\*\\\\*get notes in\\\\*\\\\*, they tend to make it \\\\*\\\\*hard to get them back out\\\\*\\\\* later, and it only \\\\*\\\\*gets worse as you add more notes\\\\*\\\\*. Dendron helps you \\\\*\\\\*get notes back out\\\\*\\\\* and \\\\*\\\\*works better\\\\*\\\\* the \\\\*\\\\*more notes you have\\\\*\\\\*.

I originally created Dendron because I'd accumulated over \\\\*\\\\*20k notes\\\\*\\\\* on programming and various other topics and couldn't find a tool that would let me easily add and find notes from within my knowledge base. 

Traditional note-taking tools are often \\\\*\\\\*too rigid\\\\*\\\\* by having an in-flexible hierarchy that doesn't let you file a note in multiple places. Newer tools are \\\\*\\\\*too flexible\\\\*\\\\* by eschewing hierarchies altogether in favour of relying solely on backlinks. 

Dendron finds the \\\\*\\\\*usable center\\\\*\\\\* between the two extremes by supporting backlinks of any two arbitrary notes while also maintaining a \\\\*\\\\*canonical hierarchy\\\\*\\\\* for every note. We do this through our \\\\*\\\\*\\\\[hierarchal first approach to note taking](https&#x3A;//www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html)\\\\*\\\\* that relies on the combination of \\\\[\\\\[hierarchies|dendron.topic.hierarchies]], \\\\[\\\\[schemas|dendron.topic.schema]], and \\\\[\\\\[path based lookups| dendron.topic.lookup]]. 

With Dendron, you can \\\\*\\\\*create, find, and collaborate\\\\*\\\\* on information that \\\\*\\\\*matters to you\\\\*\\\\*.

\\\\## Motivation

\\\\> \\"We are overwhelmed with information and we don't have the tools to properly index and filter through it. \\\\[The development of these tools, which] will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages \\\\[should] be the first objective of our scientist\\" - Vannevar Bush, 1945

\\\\## You Are Here

This project is about 1% complete, both in the sense that it is in \\\\*\\\\*preview\\\\*\\\\* but also that there's so much more to build. The north star of this project is to achieve \\\\_Vannevar Bush's\\\\_ original vision - to build a tool of thought that can give humanity \\\\_\\"\\\\*\\\\*access to\\\\*\\\\* and \\\\*\\\\*command over\\\\*\\\\* the inherited \\\\*\\\\*knowledge of the ages\\\\*\\\\*\\"\\\\_.
