## Pre-requisites

This walkthrough will help you get started with the basics of Dendron. Before you start, make sure you do the following:

- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or a VS Code compatible editor like [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)
- Install [Dendron](https://link.dendron.so/vscode) from the code marketplace

## Initialize your first workspace

A Dendron workspace is a collection of one or more [vaults](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6682fca0-65ed-402c-8634-94cd51463cc4) (folders with notes).

When you install Dendron, you'll see the following page. Click the `Get Started` button to begin, and it will initialize your first **[workspace](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/c4cf5519-f7c2-4a23-b93b-1c9a02880f6b)**.
