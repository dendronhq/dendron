This note contains some examples of extended image links. The next image will have a fixed, small size.

![logo alt text](/assets/images/logo.png){width: 200px}

![logo alt text](/assets/images/logo.png){max-height: 60px, width: 50%, opacity: 0.8, float: right, margin: 20px, border: "1px solid black"}

The image should be floating on the right, allowing text to wrap around it. It will be slightly translucent, and will have a black border around it.
