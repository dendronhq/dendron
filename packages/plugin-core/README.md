The **hierarchical** note taking tool that **grows** as you do.

Dendron is an **open-source, local-first, markdown-based, note-taking tool** built on top of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Like most such tools, Dendron supports all the usual features you would expect like tagging, backlinks, a graph view, split panes, and so forth. But it doesn't stop there - whereas most tools (try to) make it easy to **get notes in**, they tend to make it **hard to get them back out** later, and it only **gets worse as you add more notes**. Dendron helps you **get notes back out** and **works better** the **more notes you have**.

I originally created Dendron because I'd accumulated over **20k notes** on programming and various other topics and couldn't find a tool that would let me easily add and find notes from within my knowledge base.

Traditional note-taking tools are often **too rigid** by having an in-flexible hierarchy that doesn't let you file a note in multiple places. Newer tools are **too flexible** by eschewing hierarchies altogether in favour of relying solely on backlinks.

Dendron finds the **usable center** between the two extremes by supporting the linking of any two arbitrary notes through backlinks while also maintaining a **canonical hierarchy** for every note. We do this through a form of **structured note-taking** that relies on the combination of [[hierarchies|dendron.topic.hierarchies]], [[schemas | dendron.topic.schema]], and [[path based lookups | dendron.topic.lookup]]. Read our [[quickstart | dendron.quickstart]] to learn about the details.

You can use Dendron to **create, organize, and publish** all the information that **matters to you**.

## Use Cases

Whether you organize your notes with [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) or [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/), link notes together like [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), or simply create notes in an ad-hoc manner, Dendron can help.

Think of it as a [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) to help you **make sense** of all the information you care about.

Some popular use cases include:

- project management
- personal knowledge base of things you've learned
- CRM to keep track of clients, friends and enemies
- recipe book
