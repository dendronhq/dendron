If you would like to contribute to the development of Dendron, checkout out the [Dendron repo](https://link.dendron.so/github) from GitHub.

You can then follow the [Dendron Plugin Quickstart](https://docs.dendron.so/notes/64f0e2d5-2c83-43df-9144-40f2c68935aa) to get started with development.

A great place to start is with issues labelled with the [size.small](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/size.small) label on GitHub. These are small, self contained tasks that are well suited for first time contributors.

Leave a comment in the issue if you decide to work on it. Issues that are being worked on will be assigned to a person already.

The development process for dendron is described in [here](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/7aFrHnTNespaRzhlTwftM.html).
Remember that you are always welcome to ask for help inside the [#dev Discord channel](https://link.dendron.so/discord).
