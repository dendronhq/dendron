# Welcome to Dendron ðŸ‘‹

Dendron is a note taking tool that helps **people** organize and make of sense of **any amount** of information. It works by making it easy to add, edit and structure your knowledge using **flexible hierarchies**.  We call this the [hierarchy first approach](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html) to knowledge management.

## How do I get started?

Launch the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type `Dendron: Initialize Workspace`.

We've created a helpful tutorial for newcomers [here](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/678c77d9-ef2c-4537-97b5-64556d6337f1.html). We also do personal onboardings for new users which you can book [here](https://calendly.com/d/mqtk-rf7q/onboard).
