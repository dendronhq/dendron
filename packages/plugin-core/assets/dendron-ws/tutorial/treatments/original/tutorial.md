## Welcome to Dendron

This guide will help you learn the basics of Dendron. You can also follow the Getting Started guides on our [website](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/678c77d9-ef2c-4537-97b5-64556d6337f1.html).

By the end of the tutorial, you will also see how Dendron can help you manage your knowledge with super fast lookup, flexible hierarchies, and powerful linking.

If you close VS Code, you can always get back to this workspace by going to `File > Open Workspace` in VS Code's menu and then select `dendron.code-workspace` in your Dendron workspace root.
