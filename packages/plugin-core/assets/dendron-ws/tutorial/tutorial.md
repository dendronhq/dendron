## Welcome to Dendron

This guide will help you learn the basics of Dendron. You will see how Dendron can help you manage your knowledge with super fast lookup, flexible hierarchies, and powerful linking.

If you close VS Code, you can always get back to this workspace by going to `File > Open Workspace` in VS Code's menu and then selecting your workspace file: `%WORKSPACE_ROOT%`

The tutorial steps take about 10 minutes to complete.
