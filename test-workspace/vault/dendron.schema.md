## Create new schema
```md
1. Run `cmd+shift+l` 
2. Enter `dvd` (which should not exist)
3. Create the following schema within dvd.schema.yml:
`
version: 1
imports: []
schemas:
  - id: dvd
    children: 
      - pattern: h1
    title: dvd
    parent: root
`
4. Look up note (`cmd+l`) `dvd.` 
EXPECTED: should see a schema completion `dvd.h1`.

AFTER: delete schema file `dvd.schema.yml`
```
