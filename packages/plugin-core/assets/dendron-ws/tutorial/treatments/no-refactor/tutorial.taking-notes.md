## Access the Lookup Bar

You can interact with Dendron using the Lookup bar. Use the **Lookup Bar** for both finding notes and creating new notes. Enter `Dendron: Lookup` (`Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L`) to open the [Lookup Bar](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3).

## Create a Note

To create a note in Dendron, do the following:

1. Enter `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` to open the lookup bar.
2. Enter a name for your new note. For example, you can type `recipes`
3. Click **Create New**.
4. Press **Enter**. A new note titled `recipes.md` is created in the system. You can now add content to the body of your `recipes` note.

> 💡 **TIP:** Enter `Ctrl+Tab` / `Cmd+Tab` shortcut to go back to the previous note that you were viewing.

> 💡 **INFO:** Notes in Dendron are just plaintext [markdown](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ba97866b-889f-4ac6-86e7-bb2d97f6e376). Notes:
>
> - Live locally on your file system.
> - Are portable across operating systems and a variety of software.
> - Make importing/exporting easier, including [publishing your notes to a hosted website](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/4ushYTDoX0TYQ1FDtGQSg).

## Add metadata information to your Note

The `---` section at the top of each note is **frontmatter**.

Frontmatter are custom attributes at the top of each Markdown file that are marked by `---`.
In Dendron, this is autogenerated when the note is created and used to store metadata about each note.

You can add metadata information to your note using frontmatter attributes.

> 💡 **TIP:** Keep in mind the following rules while entering the frontmatter attributes to your note.
>
> - Don't modify the `id` or `created` attributes.
> - The `updated` attribute automatically _updates_ whenever you make a new modification to a file.
> - See **[reserved keys in frontmatter](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ffec2853-c0e0-4165-a368-339db12c8e4b)** for more information.

## Create a hierarchy for your Note

Dendron organizes your notes into hierarchies. These are `.` ("dot" or "period") delimited Markdown files.

## Example

Below is a hypothetical hierarchy for a file tree:

```
.
└── project1/
    ├── designs/
    │   └── promotion.png
    ├── paperwork/
    │   └── legal.md
    └── tasks/
        ├── task1.md
        └── task2.md
```

The same hierarchy in Dendron would look like the following:

```
.
├── project1.md
├── project1.designs.md
├── project1.designs.promotion.md
├── project1.paperwork.md
├── project1.paperwork.legal.md
├── project1.tasks.md
├── project1.tasks.task1.md
└── project1.tasks.task2.md
```

To create a hierarchy, do the following:

1. Enter `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` to open the lookup bar.
2. Enter a name with a `.` ("dot") delimiter. For example, you can type `recipes.vegetarian` to create a note to store your vegetarian recipes.
3. Press **Enter**.
   You've created your first hierarchy!

> 💡 **TIP:** Lookup support tab-autocomplete. Typing `rec` in the Lookup Bar, and hitting `tab` should automatically spell out `recipes`.

Click **Tree View** to see the `vegetarian` note under the `recipes` hierarchy. You can also see the note stored as `recipes.vegetarian.md` in the File Explorer Pane.

**[Hierarchies](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/f3a41725-c5e5-4851-a6ed-5f541054d409)** in Dendron are created by having a `.` ("dot") delimiter in the file name. See [What's with the .'s?](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/f3a41725-c5e5-4851-a6ed-5f541054d409) for detailed information on how hierarchy works.

### View children Notes

In the example listed above, **vegetarian** is considered as a child note of **recipes**. When looking at the `recipes` note, the preview view will list `vegetarian` (and any other `recipes.*` notes) at the bottom as **Children.** Children notes can also be seen and navigated via the tree view.

### Create a hierarchy at any level

You can create a hierarchy at any level. For example, type `recipes.italian.desserts.tiramisu` in the lookup bar and press **Enter**.

You'll see there is a `+` sign next to `italian` and `desserts` when viewing in the lookup or tree view. The plus sign indicates that this note is a stub. A **[stub](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50)** is a placeholder for a note that hasn't been created. Dendron uses stubs to avoid cluttering your file system with empty notes when creating hierarchies.

![Tree View Dark](https://org-dendron-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tutorial-tree-view-dark.png)

Following this recipes example, you can create other related notes. Some examples:

```
recipes.favorites
recipes.italian.appetizers
recipes.chinese
recipes.chinese.appetizers.wontons
recipes.ingredients.favorites
recipes.ingredients.shopping-list
```

## Find your Notes

To find your notes, do the following:

1. Enter `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` to open the lookup bar.
2. Enter the name of your note. For example, you can type `vege` to find your `recipes.vegetarian` note.
3. Press **Enter**. The note is opened.

> 💡 **INFO:** Lookup uses _fuzzy search_, which means you can type out partial queries and still see the results.Entering multiple keywords delimited by space will lookup matching notes regardless of order of the > keywords.
>
> - Example: `vege rec` or `rec vege` will match the `recipes.vegetarian` note.

> 💡 **TIP:** Read [Finding Notes](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/84a0366a-eab5-4862-9bef-360f92a196dc) to understand the different ways of querying the lookup.
> Most queries can be satisfied using [lookup](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/84a0366a-eab5-4862-9bef-360f92a196dc), but sometimes you want to do a full text search across the **contents** of your notes. This can be done with `Search: Find in Files` (`Ctrl+Shift+F` / `Cmd+Shift+F`), which leverages VS Code [built-in search](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_search-across-files) capabilities.

### Meeting Notes

Dendron also has a few built-in note types. For example, if you find yourself taking meeting notes often, you can use the `Dendron: Create Meeting Note` command to create a note with a pre-built template for meetings. Try it out!
